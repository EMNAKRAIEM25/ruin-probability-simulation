# Ruin Probability Simulation

This project focuses on evaluating the **probability of ruin**, **loss quantiles**, and **financial risk levels** in the insurance industry using classical **risk theory** and **Monte Carlo simulation** techniques. The goal is to help insurance professionals gain a better understanding of the financial risks and make informed decisions based on simulated models.

## 📌 Objectives

- Estimate the probability of ruin over a finite and infinite horizon.
- Simulate claims frequency and severity distributions.
- Compute extreme quantiles of total loss using Pareto and Weibull distributions.
- Visualize simulation results.
- Deploy the simulation and visualization with **Streamlit**.

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Classical Risk Theory Model
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- Pareto & Weibull Distributions
- Quantile Estimation
- Probability Convergence Analysis

## 📊 Technologies

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing interactive exploration of simulation results and parameter variations.
